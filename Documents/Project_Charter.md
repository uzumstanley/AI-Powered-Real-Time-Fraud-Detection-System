Status: Draft

1. Executive Summary

Financial institutions in London face escalating challenges in detecting and preventing fraudulent activities due to increasing transaction volumes and sophisticated fraud schemes. This project aims to develop an AI-powered, real-time fraud detection system leveraging Microsoft's BitNet b1.58 2B4T. The system will provide efficient, accurate, and scalable solutions to identify and mitigate fraudulent transactions, ensuring compliance with UK financial regulations.

2. Project Purpose and Justification

2.1 Purpose
To design and implement a real-time fraud detection system that utilizes BitNet b1.58 2B4T's lightweight architecture, enabling financial institutions to promptly identify and respond to fraudulent activities with minimal computational resources.

2.2 Justification
Regulatory Compliance: Align with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidelines and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates.
Operational Efficiency: Reduce false positives and detection time, enhancing customer trust and satisfaction.
Cost-Effectiveness: Utilize BitNet's resource-efficient model to minimize infrastructure costs.â€‹

3. Objectives

Accuracy: Achieve a fraud detection accuracy rate of at least 95%.
Latency: Ensure real-time processing with a latency of less than 200 milliseconds per transaction.
Scalability: Design the system to handle up to 10,000 transactions per second.
Compliance: Incorporate features to support FCA reporting and GDPR compliance.â€‹

4. High-Level Project Requirements

Data Ingestion Module: Capable of real-time transaction data collection and preprocessing.
AI Model Integration: Implement BitNet b1.58 2B4T for efficient fraud detection.
User Interface: Develop dashboards for monitoring, alerts, and reporting.
Security Measures: Ensure data encryption, access controls, and audit trails.â€‹

5. Stakeholders

Project Sponsor: Stanley Ekene Uzum
Project Manager: Solomon Cheren
Development Team: Stanley Ekene Uzum
Financial Institutions: Potential end-users and collaborators
Regulatory Bodies: FCA, GDPR compliance authorities
