ðŸš€Â Just Launched: End-to-End Real-Time Fraud Detection System!Â ðŸš€

I'm excited to share my latest projectâ€”a full-stack, real-time fraud detection platform built from scratch! This project demonstrates my expertise in data engineering, machine learning, backend API development, and modern frontend engineering.

What I built:
ðŸ”¹Â Data Engineering & Feature Engineering:
* Designed a robust PostgreSQL schema to store and manage transaction data.
* Engineered features such as transaction statistics, user behavior metrics, and categorical encodings to maximize fraud detection accuracy.

ðŸ”¹Â Machine Learning:
* Developed and trained an unsupervised Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection using scikit-learn.
* Built a preprocessing pipeline with scaling and one-hot encoding to ensure consistent, production-ready inference.
* Automated model serialization and deployment using joblib.

ðŸ”¹Â Backend API (FastAPI):
* Built RESTful endpoints for transaction ingestion and real-time fraud scoring.
* Integrated the ML model and preprocessing pipeline for seamless, low-latency predictions.
* Implemented robust error handling, CORS support, and database integration.

ðŸ”¹Â Frontend (React):
* Developed an intuitive dashboard to visualize transactions, fraud alerts, and scoring results in real time.
* Built a transaction scoring form for instant feedback and model transparency.
* Leveraged Axios for smooth API communication and React hooks for state management.

ðŸ”¹Â Testing & DevOps:
* Wrote comprehensive unit tests for both backend and frontend.
* Used environment variables and .env files for secure, configurable deployments.
* Ensured full system alignment with automated integration tests.

Tech Stack:â€¨Python, FastAPI, scikit-learn, PostgreSQL, React, Axios, Docker, pgAdmin

Key Skills Demonstrated:
* End-to-end ML system design
* API development & integration
* Database modeling
* Frontend engineering
* Automated testing & CI/CD best practices
