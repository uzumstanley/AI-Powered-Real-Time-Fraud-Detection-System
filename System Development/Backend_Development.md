Here is a step-by-step guide to implement a production-ready FastAPI backend for real-time fraud detection. We’ll cover installing dependencies, loading your 1-bit ONNX model, caching with Redis, defining REST and WebSocket endpoints, persisting to PostgreSQL, adding security and logging, and testing—all with code examples and best-practice citations.

Summary

We will create a FastAPI service that:

Loads your 1-bit quantized ONNX model with ONNX Runtime for sub-millisecond inference 
FastAPI
.
Caches hot data (model session, user aggregates) in Redis to minimize latency 
Redis
.
Exposes endpoints for transaction ingestion (POST /transactions/ingest), scoring (POST /transactions/score), and live alerts via WebSockets 
Medium
.
Persists raw and scored transactions in PostgreSQL (with Psycopg2) and pushes alerts to Redis Streams for downstream workflows 
wiki.postgresql.org
FastAPI
.
Secures APIs with JWT authentication, HTTPS, and logs all operations for FCA audit trails 
FastAPI
