Here’s a comprehensive roadmap for **Phase 5: System Development (Weeks 7–8)**—covering backend APIs, frontend dashboards, and database integration—structured for real-time fraud detection and alerts in a London financial institution context. Each section highlights key technologies, best practices, and implementation tips.

> **Summary:**  
> For the **backend**, we’ll build a **FastAPI** service exposing REST/WebSocket endpoints for transaction ingestion and model inference, leveraging async I/O, request batching, and Redis caching for low latency.  
> On the **frontend**, we’ll use **Plotly Dash** (or **Streamlit**) alongside **Evidently** for real-time monitoring dashboards, with live updates via WebSocket or server‐sent events.  
> For **database integration**, we’ll store raw and scored transactions in **PostgreSQL** (with TimescaleDB for time-series) or **MongoDB** for flexible schema, and employ **Redis** for hot-state caching and alert thresholds.

## ## Backend Development

### ### 1. Framework & API Design  
- **FastAPI** is ideal for ML inference APIs: it’s asynchronous, high-performance, and automatically generates OpenAPI docs.  
- **Endpoints**:  
  - `POST /transactions/ingest` for incoming transaction data.  
  - `POST /transactions/score` to run fraud scoring via the XGBoost/BitNet model.  
  - `GET /alerts` for retrieving active alerts.  
- **Batching & Caching**:  
  - Use **Redis** to cache model artifacts and hot user‐feature lookups, reducing latency on repeated requests citeturn0search15.  
  - Support **batch inference** by queuing multiple requests and processing together with `asyncio.gather` or background tasks, lowering per-request overhead.

### ### 2. Model Serving  
- Wrap your **1-bit quantized ONNX** model with **ONNX Runtime** in FastAPI, leveraging its **InferenceSession** for sub-millisecond scoring.  
- For ultra-low-latency, consider **gRPC** endpoints or **WebSockets** to push scores back to clients as soon as inference completes.  
- **Health checks** (`GET /health`) to verify model load status, Redis connectivity, and database reachability.

### ### 3. Security & Compliance  
- Enforce **HTTPS** with TLS certificates (e.g., via Let’s Encrypt).  
- Implement **JWT-based** authentication/authorization, restricting endpoints to trusted clients.  
- Log all requests and inference results to support **FCA audit trails**, including input features and model version.

## ## Frontend Development

### ### 1. Dashboard Frameworks  
- **Plotly Dash**: Quick to build interactive charts, supports live updates via callbacks.  
- **Evidently.ai** integration: Out-of-the-box profile and drift monitoring, embedding reports directly into Dash or Streamlit.  
- **Streamlit**: Extremely simple to deploy; ideal for prototyping real-time model performance UIs.

### ### 2. Key Dashboard Components  
- **Transaction Feed**: Table showing recent transactions, color-coded by fraud score threshold.  
- **Alert Panel**: List of flagged high-risk transactions with real-time updates via **server-sent events** or **WebSocket**.  
- **Performance Metrics**:  
  - Time-series chart of anomaly scores over time.  
  - Distribution histograms of transaction amounts and features.  
  - Model drift alerts when input feature distributions shift.

### ### 3. UX & Responsiveness  
- Use **Tailwind CSS** or **Bootstrap** for responsive layouts.  
- Implement **role-based views**: Basic users see summary metrics; analysts get drill-downs.  
- **Export**: CSV/PDF export functionality for audit reports.

## ## Database Integration

### ### 1. Choice of Database  
- **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB**:  
  - Leverage time-series hypertables for efficient windowed queries on transaction streams.  
  - Strong schema guarantees and ACID compliance, matching financial regulations.  
- **MongoDB** (optional):  
  - Flexible schema for evolving feature sets and unstructured data like raw logs.  
- **Redis**:  
  - In-memory cache for latest transaction scores and feature lookups, enabling blazingly fast access.

### ### 2. Schema Design  
- **Transactions Table**:  
  - Columns: `transaction_id`, `account_id`, `features JSONB`, `score`, `is_fraud_flag`, `timestamp`.  
  - Index on `timestamp` and `score` for alert queries.  
- **Alerts Table**:  
  - Columns: `alert_id`, `transaction_id`, `alert_type`, `created_at`, `status`.  
- **Feature Store** (optional):  
  - Real-time feature table keyed by `account_id`, storing rolling aggregates for streaming inference.

### ### 3. Data Pipeline  
- **Ingestion**: FastAPI writes raw transactions to PostgreSQL, then publishes IDs to a **Kafka** or **Redis Stream** for asynchronous scoring.  
- **Scoring Worker**: Consumer reads from the stream, fetches features, runs ONNX inference, writes back `score` and `is_fraud_flag` to the DB.  
- **Alerting**: Triggers in Postgres or a separate worker check for scores above threshold, inserting into the Alerts table and pushing notifications via WebSocket.

## ## Deployment & DevOps

### ### 1. Containerization  
- **Docker** all components: FastAPI app, scoring worker, database (as a service), and dashboard.  
- Use **Docker Compose** for local development; **Kubernetes** for production with **Helm** charts.

### ### 2. CI/CD  
- **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI** pipelines to build, test (unit + integration), lint, and push Docker images to **Docker Hub** or **ECR**.  
- Automated **DB migrations** with **Flyway** or **Alembic**.

### ### 3. Monitoring & Logging  
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Track API latencies, error rates, queue lag, and model performance metrics.  
- **Evidently**: Monitor data drift and performance drift; trigger alerts if metrics degrade.  
- Centralized logs in **ELK** or **Datadog** for audit and compliance.
